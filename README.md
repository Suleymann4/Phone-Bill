# Phone-Bill
The aim of this project is to practice on parametric functions, returning functions, reference parameters and if-else statements. The use of if-else statements is necessary in this problem; however, the use of functions is for good (modular) programming design. That means, it is possible to accomplish this project without using functions, but it is a must to use them. The details about the use of functions in this project are given later.
